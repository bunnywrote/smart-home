# Ionic Visual Studio Starter Kit
This project is just a starter kit for blank Ionic 3 project in Visual Studio 2017.  All I have done is updated all of the references needed for the blank template and verified they would run in debug mode.  This project has been updated to run under Ionic 3.6.0  You can find more about Ionic 3 and how to get it running in Visual Studio by following my blog post @ https://brettthewhitt.com/2017/05/18/ionic-package-and-ionic-3-setup-tutorial/
